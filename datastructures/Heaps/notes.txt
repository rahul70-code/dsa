Objectives:
1. what is binary heap?
2. compare and contrast min and max heaps.
3. implement basic methods on heaps.
4. Understand where heaps are used in real world and what 
other data structures can be constructed from heaps.

binary heap?
very similar to binary search trees but with some different rules

In a maxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
In a minBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

why we need to know heap?
priority queues
graph traversal algorithms

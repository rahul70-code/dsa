/**
 * Notes
 * 1. special variation of stack
 * 2. used - range queries in an array
 * 3. the monotonic stacks helps us maintain max and min elements in the range
 * and keeps the order of elements in the range.
 * 4. when a element is popped from the monotonic stack, it will never be used
 * again.
 * example problems - largest rectangle in histogram, trapping rain water

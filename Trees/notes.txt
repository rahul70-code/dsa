BFS:
visit every node of same level. working horizontally.
- create a queue and a variable to stores the values of nodes visited.
- Place the root node in the queue.
- loop as long as there is anything in the queue
 - dequeue a node from the queue and push the value of the node into the
 variable that stores the nodes.

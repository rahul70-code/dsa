Selection sort
- store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
- compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
- if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new minimum and
continue until the end of the array.
- if the minimum is not the value(index) you initially began with, swap the two values.

Insertion sort
- start by picking the second element in the array.
- Now compare the second element with the one before it and swap if neccessary.
- continue to the next element and if it is in the incorrect order, iterate through
the sorted portion to place the element in the correct place.
- repeat until the array is sorted. 



big 0-> when array is unsorted => O(n2)
        when array is sorted => O(n)

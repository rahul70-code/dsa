- store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
- compare this item to the next item in the array until you find a smaller number.
- if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new minimum and
continue until the end of the array.
- if the minimum is not the value(index) you initially began with, swap the two values.

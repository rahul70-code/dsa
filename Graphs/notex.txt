objectives:
- explain what the Graph is.
- compare and contrast different types of Graphs and their use cases in real world.
- implement the Graph using adjacency list.
- Transverse through the Graphs using BFS, DFS.
- compare and contrast Graph Transversal algorithms.

Graph
Nodes + connections

vertex = Node
edge = connection betweeen the Nodes

weighted Graph = value assigned to edges

directed VS Undirected Graphs
weighted VS unweighted Graphs

adjacency matrix
adjacency list

Graph Transversal uses:
1. peer to peer networking
2. web crawlers.
3. finding closest/ matches/ recommendations.
4. shortest path algorithms
    a. gps navigation.
    b. solving mazes.
    c. AI shortest path to win the games.

/**
 * Core Strategy

It's another counting problem. What we need to do is:

    *********counting the frequency for every target
    *********find out the number with the max frequency

It's easy to think about using a 2 times traversal - 1 time for counting and another time for finding the max.
But, actually, we could finish it in just 1-time traversal by maintaining a variable of the max frequency.

Count with map

We just follow the strategy, use a map to save the frequency, nothing more.

Here's a sample code from me:
 */

const mostFrequent = (nums, key) => {
    const freq = {};
    let ret = 0;
    for (let i = 0, max = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {
        if (nums[i] !== key) continue;
        const target = nums[i + 1];
        freq[target] = (freq[target] || 0) + 1;
        if (freq[target] > max) {
            max = freq[target];
            ret = target;
        }
    }
    return ret;
};

/**
 * Count with array

We use a fixed-length array to save the frequency, and I try to make the code shorter.

Here's a sample code from me:
 */

const mostFrequentImprovement = (nums, key) => {
    const freq = new Uint16Array(1001);
    let ret = 0;
    for (let i = 0, max = 0; i < nums.length - 1; ++i) {
        const target = nums[i + 1];
        nums[i] === key && ++freq[target] > max && ((max = freq[target]), (ret = target));
    }
    return ret;
};


console.log(mostFrequent([1, 100, 200, 1, 100,1,200,1,200,1,200], 1))
